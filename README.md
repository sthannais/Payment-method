## Instructions

The `backend` directory contains an API built using Express and the `frontend` directory a React app built using Create React App.

Each package has its own set of instructions inside the package's main file.

Some things might not work by default and others are poorly designed intentionally. Feel free to fix, modify or even redesign as needed.

To show the results of your work, fork this repo and then push your code to *your own* repo and share the URL by email.

Finally, create a video showing and *explaining* *all* of your changes and show your working solution. We recommend using Loom but feel free to use any tool you like. Do this in Spanish.

Good luck!
